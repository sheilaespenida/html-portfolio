<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. I am Sheila Espenida and you can simply call me "Shey". I am 28 yrs old and living in Metro Manila. I am the
  eldest daughter in our family and I have four siblings. I am a graduate of BSECE last 2019 and I worked in the field
  of Telecommunications for 4 years. As of the moment, I am still looking for a job and at the same time I am
  studying courses about programming because I've decide to shift my career.</p>

<p>Aside from being an ordinary person, I am a music lover. I'm always listening to KPOP and rock music. I am a fan of
  boy bands and rock bands. I love DAY6 and Paramore a lot. I would recommend listening to their songs, not just title
  track but more importantly, the b-sides. I am fond of attending concerts because it's my escape from reality and my
  joy. I also love watching Netflix series like: Anime, K-drama and Western. I am attracted to dark, fantasy, action and
  fiction genres. What I like most about watching is the climax where there are many plot twist and I want the kind
  of story that makes the viewer thinks, and concludes for the ending. I would recommend watching One Piece since I am
  addicted to it right now and the story line is full of twist and adventures. </p>

<p>I wanted to become a Web Developer because I want to continue my passion. Before I become an Engineer, I started with
  an IT course but since we're lack of money that time, I transferred to a University and shifted my course. However,
  after I graduated I immediately look for a job to help my family sustain our needs. I became a Design Engineer and
  continue it for 4 years. The very thing that changed my mind was the trend and sustainability. If you would take a
  look on the trend of employment right now, most are in the IT and BPO industry. I want to take this opportunity to
  develop my career, seek for my edge and look for an employer with a strong foundation. I am looking for a stable job
  that continuously provide knowledge growth and experiences.</p>
