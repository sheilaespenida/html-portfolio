<h1>The Best Anime Series According to Shey</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Anime of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>This is one of my current ongoing series this 2024 and I really liked it because it has different kinds of
    adventures and it shows true meaning of friendship through Straw
    Hat Pirates. I really admire each characters and their relationship. I love Chopper and Luffy!</p>
<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>This was the first anime series I watched and finished on Netflix. I also love this anime because of its unique story
    line, the powers and characters are superb. I already finished reading its Manga and honestly, I encountered
    different kinds of conflicts but it's really worth it. It is still ongoing though and I am still looking forward to
    the story.</p>
<h3>Apothecary Diaries</h3>
<p>This is also one of my ongoing anime on Netflix. I love the relationship that Jinshi and Maomao have. I am always
    rooting on every episode and the story itself is really addicting. I can't wait to read its Manga.</p>
